        <p>I am a Web Developer living in the greater Philadelphia metro area. I have a strong background in graphic art, production art, and variable data. I have had the pleasure of working in all different types of organizations, ranging from small mom-and-pops to large multi-national corporations.</p>
        
        <p>I love to learn, I love to help people, and I love to innovate. My approach to innovation is to keep it clean and simple. I'm currently looking for opportunities in organizations with growth potential that shares these values.</p>
